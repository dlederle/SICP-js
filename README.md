Documenting my progress through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)
During Summer 2012, I plan on watching the lectures, reading the text, and completing the exercises.
My goal is to do the programming in Javascript as much as possible.

I will use this repo to hold my short written thoughts on the book, as well as my exercise solutions.
