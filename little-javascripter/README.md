Douglas Crockford's [writeup of doing *The Little Schemer* in Javascript](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/little.html) was the inspiration for doing SICP.
I'm working through *The Little Schemer* concurrently with the beginning of SICP.

I used Crockford's Little-js basic functions, although some of them didn't work as I expected so I modified them. I use them to write scheme-y js solutions for the rest of the book.
